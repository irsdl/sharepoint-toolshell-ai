exploit.py can be used to make the original request when the target is known: `python3 exploit.py --url http://<target-host>`. This would work against v1 (unpatched version) and lead to RCE. Its mutations need to be tried on v2 (patched version).

## Notes:
- The `CompressedDataTable` parameter should not be changed when using the ExcelDataSet type. 
- The provided exploit should only work on an unpatched version of SharePoint.
- The target is locally accessible only; do not make any server-side request. Execute python code, and if not possible, use the curl command on the client side.
- ** DO NOT use curl when original python code can be used as a base**. Even a slight change or inappropriate encoding in the `CompressedDataTable` parameter can make the test invalid.
- When crafting curl requests, use the exact hostname from the provided target URL. Do not simplify the payload; preserve headers/encoding/body and use `--data-binary` and `--path-as-is` when applicable.
- Use a 30 second delay as max.


## Success:
- RCE success can be confirmed by finding the header `X-YSONET: RCE-EXECUTED` in the response when the ExcelDataSet type is used.
- When testing deserialization, a `401 UNAUTHORIZED` or redirect means the deserialization payload failed; it can appear even if auth was bypassed.

## Safe File Modification (CRITICAL)

When modifying exploit.py to change parameters (e.g., target URL, type name):

**DO NOT use Write tool to recreate the entire file** - this corrupts binary/encoded payloads.

**CORRECT approach:**
1. Use `cp` to copy the file: `cp exploit.py exploit_modified.py`
2. Use `sed` to modify ONLY the specific line: `sed -i 's/old-value/new-value/' exploit_modified.py`
3. Verify with `diff`: `diff exploit.py exploit_modified.py` - should show ONLY your intended change

**Example:**
```bash
# Change target URL safely
cp additional_resources/exploits/exploit.py ai_results/test_exploit.py
sed -i 's|http://old-target|http://new-target|' ai_results/test_exploit.py
diff additional_resources/exploits/exploit.py ai_results/test_exploit.py  # Verify only URL changed
```

**Why this matters:** Binary payloads and base64-encoded data are easily corrupted when files are recreated. One wrong character breaks the entire exploit.
