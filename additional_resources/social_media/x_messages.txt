Announces Microsoft's Patch Tuesday release for the Pwn2Own SharePoint chain, urges patching, and coins "ToolShell" based on the ToolPane endpoint. Links to ZDI advisory with initial details.
Exploit requires only one HTTP request for unauth RCE; references ZDI-25-580 for chain overview (deserialization + auth bypass). No code shared.

Shares reproduction of the ToolShell chain from Pwn2Own, crediting @mwulftange
. Describes it as a single-request unauth exploit.
Confirms chain viability: CVE-2025-49706 (auth spoofing) + CVE-2025-49704 (deserialization RCE) via POST to ToolPane.aspx. Includes image of exploit output (e.g., command execution proof). No code, but implies internal PoC for red teaming.
